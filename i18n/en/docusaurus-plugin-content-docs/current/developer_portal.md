# Developer Portal

In the **APIPark** platform, the **Developer Portal** is a centralized platform aimed at consumers for showcasing, managing, and accessing various API services (including REST services and AI services). The main goal of the Developer Portal is to assist developers (i.e., consumers) in easily finding, subscribing to, invoking, and managing API services while ensuring efficient collaboration with service providers.
