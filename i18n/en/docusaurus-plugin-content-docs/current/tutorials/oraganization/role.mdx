3. **Permissions Management**:
   - **Fine-Grained Permissions Control**: Supports fine-grained permissions control of system functions and data, enabling administrators to flexibly adjust the permissions settings for each role based on actual needs.

4. **Role and Member Association**:
   - **System Role Assignment**: In the member management module, administrators can assign system-level roles to members, enabling them to access and operate system-level resources and functions.
   - **Team Role Assignment**: In the team module's member management functionality, administrators can assign team-level roles to members, granting them the corresponding permissions within the team to support effective team operations.
