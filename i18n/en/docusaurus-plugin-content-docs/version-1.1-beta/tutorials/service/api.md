# Configure API (OpenAPI)

**OpenAPI** is a widely used specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. Originally known as **Swagger**, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) provides a structured way to define an API's interface, including its endpoints, operations, requests, responses, and other associated metadata. OpenAPI aims to make the design, development, documentation generation, and testing of APIs simpler and more consistent.

**APIPark** supports OpenAPI V2.0 and V3.0 formats, allowing you to upload OpenAPI YAML files to create API documentation.

The API documentation configured within the service will be displayed in the service plaza after publishing, as shown below:
