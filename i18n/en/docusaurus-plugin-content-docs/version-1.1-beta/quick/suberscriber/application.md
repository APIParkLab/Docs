# Add Application

**Applications** are units through which service subscribers manage and organize API subscriptions. Each subscriber can create and manage multiple applications, and perform operations on API services on an application basis. This setup allows for flexible management of API subscriptions and calls across different projects or business lines.

## Demonstration
