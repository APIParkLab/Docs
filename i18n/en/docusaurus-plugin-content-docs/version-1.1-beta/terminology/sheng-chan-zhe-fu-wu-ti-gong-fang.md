# Producer / Service Provider

In `APIPark`, a producer or service provider is a user or entity that creates, manages, and publishes API services. Service providers can include internal development teams, third-party developers, partners, or any organization capable of and authorized to publish API services on the platform. By publishing services, producers enable consumers to use their data, functionality, and business logic in the form of APIs.
