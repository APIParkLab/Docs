# Release

Releasing a service version is a crucial step in deploying the latest configured services and APIs to a production environment, ensuring that subscribers can access the APIs of the latest released version when invoked. By releasing a service version, you can manage the lifecycle of APIs and services uniformly, ensuring that the latest configurations of services and APIs take effect in a timely manner, maintaining the stability and reliability of the system.

After executing the release operation, if the current service is an `external service`, it will be displayed in the service plaza.

## Operation Demo
