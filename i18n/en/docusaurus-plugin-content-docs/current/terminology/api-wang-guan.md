# API Gateway

## What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a server that acts as a single entry point between internal system services and external clients. The API Gateway manages the routing and protocol translation of all API calls. It is responsible for receiving all external requests and routing them to the appropriate microservices, while also performing tasks such as authentication, load balancing, caching, rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.

## Why does APIPark need an API Gateway?

`APIPark` needs an API Gateway to provide a range of essential functions and services that ensure the security, performance, and usability of APIs. Here are the main reasons why `APIPark` needs an API Gateway:

**Unified Entry Point**:

* The API Gateway serves as a single entry point, simplifying interactions between clients and multiple microservices, reducing complexity.

**Security**:

* The API Gateway can enforce authentication, authorization, and other security measures to ensure that only authorized requests can access the API.

**Load Balancing**:

* The API Gateway can distribute requests to different instances of microservices, balancing the load to ensure high availability and performance.

**Protocol Translation**:

* The API Gateway can convert external requests into the protocol format required by the internal system, such as from HTTP to gRPC or other protocols.

**Traffic Management**:

* The API Gateway can implement rate limiting and circuit breaker policies to protect backend services from overload and abnormal traffic surges.

**Monitoring and Analytics**:

* The API Gateway can log detailed information about all requests and responses, offering monitoring and analytics to help operations teams understand the system's health and performance.

**Caching**:

* The API Gateway can cache frequently accessed API responses, reducing the load on backend services and increasing response speed.

## How APIPark and the API Gateway Work Together

The collaboration between `APIPark` and the API Gateway ensures comprehensive API management and optimization, ensuring that API services are efficient, secure, and reliable. Here's how they work together:

1. **Service Deployment and Management**:
   * The open platform allows service providers to create, configure, and publish APIs, while the API Gateway is responsible for receiving these published API requests and routing them to the appropriate backend services.
   * Users can manage the API lifecycle on the open platform, including version management and release, with the API Gateway executing these versions' API calls.
   
2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   * The open platform provides user and application authentication and authorization configurations, with the API Gateway enforcing these checks on each API call to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the APIs.
   * For example, OAuth2 and API Key authentication methods configured on the open platform are enforced by the API Gateway.

3. **Traffic Control and Rate Limiting**:
   * The open platform provides API traffic control strategy configurations, such as rate limiting and circuit breaker rules, which the API Gateway implements during runtime to protect the stability of backend services.
   * This ensures that the system remains stable even under high or abnormal traffic.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   * The open platform provides monitoring and log management features, with the API Gateway collecting all API request and response log data and sending it to the open platform for analysis and display.
   * Monitoring charts and reports on the open platform show key information such as API usage, performance metrics, and error rates.

5. **Caching and Performance Optimization**:
   * Caching strategies configured on the open platform are implemented by the API Gateway, caching frequently accessed API responses to reduce the burden on backend services and improve response speed.
   * The API Gateway determines, based on configured caching strategies, which API responses need to be cached and their validity periods.

6. **Protocol Translation and Routing**:
   * The open platform allows users to configure API protocol and routing rules, with the API Gateway performing these protocol transformations and request routing in real-time to ensure that client requests reach the correct backend services.
   * For example, HTTP to gRPC conversion rules configured on the open platform are executed by the API Gateway.

## Example Explanation

**Service Deployment**:

* Service providers create and publish APIs on `APIPark`, configuring the API's paths, methods, and parameters. The API Gateway applies these configurations to actual API calls, ensuring requests are routed correctly to backend services.

**Authentication**:

* Developers configure OAuth2 authentication on `APIPark`; the API Gateway performs OAuth2 checks on each API call to ensure only authorized users can access the API.

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:

* Rate limiting strategies, like maximum request numbers per minute configured on the open platform, are implemented by the API Gateway at runtime, protecting backend services.

**Monitoring Data**:

* The API Gateway logs all API requests and responses, sending this log data to `APIPark`, where detailed call statistics and performance metrics are displayed.

The API Gateway is an integral part of `APIPark`, acting as the unified entry point for all API requests, handling tasks such as routing, authentication, traffic control, monitoring, and logging. The open platform provides API management and configuration features, while the API Gateway executes these configurations in real-time to ensure API security, performance, and availability. Through the close integration of `APIPark` and the API Gateway, users can efficiently manage and utilize APIs, enhancing the overall system's flexibility and reliability.
