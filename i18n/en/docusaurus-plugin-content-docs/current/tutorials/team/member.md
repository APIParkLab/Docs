# Team Members

In the Members module, administrators can easily add or remove team members and assign appropriate permissions to each member, ensuring that they can only access and operate the sections they are authorized to.

The permissions setting feature makes team management more flexible and secure by assigning different access levels based on different roles, such as administrators, developers, viewers, etc. This not only improves work transparency and efficiency but also ensures the secure management of sensitive information.
