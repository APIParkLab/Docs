**ü¶Ñ APIPark is an open-source one-stop AI gateway and API developer portal, helping developers and enterprises easily manage, integrate, and deploy AI services. APIPark is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license, which means it can be used commercially for free!**

‚ú® With APIPark, you can achieve the following:
1. Quickly access 100+ AI models as we support all major AI companies!
2. Combine AI models and Prompt with keywords into APIs. For instance, create a sentiment analysis API, translation API, or data analysis API using OpenAI GPT-4 and your custom prompts.
3. Unify the request data format of all AI APIs so that changes or prompt modifications won't affect your app or microservices, simplifying AI usage and maintenance costs.
4. Share APIs within your team through the APIPark developer portal.
5. Manage calling applications and API Keys to ensure API security and stability.
6. Monitor your AI API usage with clear charts.
7. Quickly output API request logs to third-party log platforms.

<br/>

‚ú®APIPark is also a powerful cloud-native API gateway:
1. Achieves higher performance than Nginx, supports cluster deployment, and can handle large-scale traffic.
2. Share REST APIs within your team and manage API calling relationships to avoid increased management costs and data leakage due to chaotic API calls.

# üíå Why did we create APIPark?
Before developing APIPark, we spent 7 years building an API development and automated testing platform, Eolink, which has over 1 million developer users, more than 500 enterprise customers, and received tens of millions of investment from Sequoia Capital.

With the advent of AI and agents, we found that many enterprises wish to integrate AI into their internal system APIs and third-party APIs, allowing AI agents to perform more complex tasks beyond simple Q&A. That's why we created APIPark, your one-stop AI gateway and API developer portal, accelerating your AI API development and helping you quickly build your products or AI agents!

<br/>

# ‚ú® Quick Start
APIPark aims to solve the following problems:
- Seamlessly integrate multiple large AI models and package these AI capabilities into APIs, significantly simplifying the usage threshold for AI models.
- Manage complex AI & API call relationships.
- Manage API creation, monitoring, and security.
- Fault detection and troubleshooting: Simplify the identification and resolution of system issues.
- Quantify the value of data assets: Improve visibility and valuation of data assets.

<br/>

üòç Deploying APIPark is incredibly simple. Just a single command line to deploy your AI gateway and API developer portal in under 5 minutes.

```
curl -sSO https://download.apipark.com/install/quick-start.sh; bash quick-start.sh
```

# üö© Roadmap
We have an exciting goal for APIPark: Enable everyone to quickly create their products and AI Agents using AI and API!

To achieve this goal, we plan to add new features to APIPark:
1. Integrate with API markets, such as Postman, RapidAPI, APISpace, APILayer, etc. You can directly use APIs from various API markets through APIPark and make those APIs smarter with AI.
2. Integrate AI Agents, such as Langchain, AgentGPT, Auto-GPT, Dify, etc. Allow AI agents to access your internal systems or third-party APIs through APIPark to accomplish more complex tasks.
3. Intelligent API Orchestration: APIPark will provide a unified API entry point that automatically judges API request content to orchestrate multiple APIs to meet your needs.
