# API Call Analysis Report

APIPark analyzes historical call data to display long-term API call trends and performance changes, helping companies maintain API stability.

> ðŸ’¡ APIPark's API call analysis report relies on the InfluxDB database. If you use the scripts provided by APIPark for deployment, InfluxDB will be installed by default. Learn more: [ðŸ”— Deploy APIPark](deploy.md).
> ðŸ’¡ You can also deploy an external InfluxDB database and fill in the InfluxDB data source information in the APIPark system settings. Learn more: [ðŸ”— Set Data Source](system_setting/data_source.md).
