## Upstream

In `APIPark`, "upstream" refers to the backend server or service where API requests are ultimately routed. The upstream typically contains the actual business logic, data storage, and applications that handle API requests. In an API gateway architecture, the gateway receives and processes requests from clients, then forwards these requests to upstream servers for processing, retrieving responses, and returning them to the clients.

## Definition

* **Upstream**: Refers to the backend server or service that handles API requests, forming the core part of business logic and data processing.

## Functions

* **Request Processing**: Receives requests from the API gateway, processes them according to business logic, and returns responses.
* **Data Storage**: Interacts with databases or other storage systems to perform data read and write operations.
* **Business Logic**: Contains the core functions and logic of the application to fulfill specific business requirements.
* **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests among multiple upstream servers to ensure high availability and performance.

## Advantages

**Separation of Concerns**:

* Upstream servers focus on business logic and data processing while the API gateway handles request routing and security control, achieving a separation of duties.

**Improved Performance and Availability**:

* Through load balancing and health check mechanisms, ensure high availability and performance of upstream servers, avoiding single points of failure.

**Flexible Expansion**:

* Upstream servers can be flexibly expanded and adjusted based on business needs, supporting horizontal scaling to enhance system processing capacity.

**Security Control**:
* By configuring security policies, ensure the security of upstream servers and the legitimacy of requests, protecting data and system security.

Upstream plays a key role in an API open platform, serving as the core backend server or service for handling API requests. Configuring upstream includes setting upstream addresses, load balancing, health checks, and security policies to ensure that API requests are correctly routed and responded to. Properly configuring upstream allows for efficient request handling, high system availability, and security, enhancing the overall platform performance and user experience. Configure your upstream now to ensure your API requests are efficiently processed and securely protected!
