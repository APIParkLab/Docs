# Consumers

In the **APIPark** platform, **consumers** refer to users who utilize the API services within the platform. Consumers can apply to subscribe to AI services or REST services to gain access permissions to the required interfaces. Once approved by the service provider, they can officially call the services. To ensure data security and compliance with access permissions, the consumer feature includes a comprehensive authentication mechanism and provides various convenient subscription management tools.

## Overview of Features
### Diverse Authentication Support
- **Flexible Authentication Methods**: Supports various authentication methods including API Key, Basic, JWT, and AK/SK, to meet the security needs of different application scenarios.
- **Dynamic Management of Authentication Configurations**: Consumers can update or manage authentication information on the portal, such as periodically refreshing API Keys or changing JWT configurations, to further enhance data security.

### Service Application and Subscription Management
- **One-Click Application**: Consumers can browse AI services and REST services displayed in the API portal, select services that meet their business needs, and initiate subscription applications.
- **Fast Approval Notifications**: Service providers will review applications, and consumers can view the approval status in real-time.
- **Subscription Status Management**: Supports consumers in viewing all subscribed services on the portal, making it easy to manage calling permissions, renew services, or cancel services that are no longer needed.
